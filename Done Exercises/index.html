                        Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all
                        aiming <br>to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our
                        <br>goal
                        is
                        to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How <br>far down? So
                        down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers <br>and have
                        them
                        download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person <br>and watch their
                        investment as is with other cryptocurrency project.<br><br>

                        We are trying to do to this space what
                        investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail <br>investors". We are gamefying digital
                        currency,
                        bringing in popular faces instead of hard <br>to understand projects to make it the norm and
                        inadvertently being the "gateway drug"<br> for a lot of people to finally give this space a
                        real
                        look.
